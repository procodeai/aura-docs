## Why ProCode AI?

Traditional automation tools like Zapier and n8n are powerful, but they lack **intelligence**. ProCode AI agents don't just execute scripts—they **perceive**, **reason**, and **act**.

::: tip Example
**Old way**: "If email received, send to Slack."  
**ProCode way**: "Understand my work patterns. When I get an urgent email during deep work, queue it. When I take a break, summarize and notify."
