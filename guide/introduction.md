# Introduction

Welcome to **ProCode AI** documentation—your guide to building intelligent, living digital organisms on macOS.

## What is ProCode AI?

ProCode AI is a **visual agent programming platform** that lets you create AI-powered automations without writing code. Unlike traditional automation tools, ProCode agents can:

- **See** your screen and understand context
- **Learn** from your preferences over time
- **Act** autonomously when appropriate
- **Remember** past interactions and decisions

## Core Philosophy

> _More than a Chatbot. A Living Digital Organism._

Traditional AI assistants wait for commands. ProCode AI **observes**, **learns**, and **acts**. By combining deep macOS integration with biological design principles (Perception, Cognition, Memory), it bridges the gap between static software and autonomous agency.

## Key Concepts

### 🧬 Agents

An **Agent** is a complete behavior unit—like a digital creature with its own purpose. For example:

- A "DJ Agent" that manages your music based on mood
- A "Research Agent" that summarizes PDFs and organizes notes
- A "Focus Agent" that manages notifications during deep work

### 📐 Blueprints

**Blueprints** are the visual representation of an agent's logic. Using the **Architect** editor, you wire together nodes to define how an agent perceives, thinks, and acts.

### 🧠 Memory

Every agent has access to a **Living Memory** system that stores:

- User preferences (learned implicitly)
- Past interactions and context
- Knowledge from conversations

## Privacy First

ProCode AI is designed with **privacy as a foundation**:

| Feature        | Privacy Approach                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| AI Processing  | 100% local with Ollama (or cloud providers by choice) |
| Screen Vision  | Never recorded, never transmitted                     |
| Voice Commands | Processed locally, never stored                       |
| User Data      | Encrypted, stored only on your Mac                    |
